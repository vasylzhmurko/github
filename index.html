			<h2>Commands - Advanced</h2>

			<ul>

				<li><strong>git revert</strong> is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier
					commits (often only a faulty one). 
					<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert" target="_blank">git-revert - Revert some existing
						commits</a>
				</li>

				<li><strong>git cherry-pick</strong> it allows you to pick up one commit from another branch and insert it
					into the current one. As an option, the commit ID is transmitted in another branch.
					<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick" target="_blank">git-cherry-pick - Apply the changes
						introduced by some
						existing commits</a>
				</li>

				<li><strong>git reset</strong> will take your branch back to a certain point in the commit history, but
					there are 3 different levels to this: soft, hard, mixed.
					<a href="https://dev.to/char_bone/how-and-when-to-use-git-reset-2om6" target="_blank">How and when to
						use git reset</a>
				</li>

				<li><strong>git rebase</strong> combines changes made in one branch with the other branch, but it rewrites
					history, because it transfers completed work.

				</li>

				<li><strong>git stash</strong> can help you to (temporarily but safely) store your uncommitted local changes
					- and leave you with a clean working copy.

		<!-- About gitignore -->

		<div class="git">
			<h2>How to use a <span class="gitignore">.gitignore </span> file and what is it?</h2>

			<p>
				We use a .gitignore file if there are some files that we
				<b>never want commit</b>. It lets Git know that it should ignore
				certain files and <b>not track them.</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Here's how it works. A .gitignore file is a plain text file where each
				line contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore. Generally,
				this is placed in the root folder of the repository. However, you can
				put it in any folder in the repository and you can also have
				multiple .gitignore files. You can also create a global .gitignore
				file and any entries in that file will be ignored in all of your Git
				repositories.
			</p>

			

			<ul class="wildcard">
				<h2>Wildcard</h2>	
				<li>
					<span> <b> * </b> </span> - matches 0 or more characters (except the/). So, for example, *.log matches
					any
					file ending with the .log
					extension.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span> <b> ! </b> </span> - as a prefix to negate a file that would be ignored, for example,
					"!example.log"
				</li>
				<li>
					<span> <b> *~ </b> </span> - matches any file ending with ~, such as "index.html~"
				</li>
